Henge
=====

Henge was an attempt at a browser based MMORPG along the lines of Nexus War/Shintolin/Urban Dead. 
It (so far) hasn't even made it to a playable alpha stage but sitting on the code wasn't doing anyone 
any favours, so here it is.

It's written in c# and sits on top of a DB4O database (if and when I come back to this much of that 
end of things will change...) and is based around a rules engine system; the idea was that a player
should be allowed to try to do almost anything to anything else and the rules system would just work
out what would happen.

It tried to model line of sight, 3d terrain and give a freely scrolling map and essentially was WAAAAAY
too ambitious for the time I and the other developers had available.

But you never know, one day I might come back and try to massage it back to life.
